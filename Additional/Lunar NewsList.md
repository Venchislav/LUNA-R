## LUNA-R Main Growth!
LUNA-R Main system is improving spreading to different components and submodules.<br>
Dev Team (1 person bruh) trying to build flexible architecture.<br>
Of course LUNA-R is not new Scikit Learn, but these are just first versions.<br>
News: <br>
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are now V 0.002
  - Details:<br> More Flexible <br> Loss Output added <br> Bug Fix
- Components:
  - Optimizers, Losses and more!

### Model Main Class!
LUNA-R is positioned not only as Framework with ready-to-use models, but also as an educational material in form of ML Framework<br>
##### Introducing: <br>
MODEL!<br>
Not a big update, but it makes development process easier and model files cleaner. <br>
All routine actions already implemented in Model class! <br>

## LUNA-R Big Update!
### Decision Tree V 0.01!
<br>
One of the:

- best
- most popular
- most useful

ML algorithms on board! <br>

Really different from previous<br>
But still great!<br>

All math functions and so on on board!<br>

Oh and...<br>

Last, but not Least...<br>
### Examples!<br>

Examples are pieces of code that you can examine and check out in order to understand framework and see its practical usage<br>

# LUNA-R MASSIVE UPDATE!
### Architecture Changed!<br>
Project had a simple architecture scheme:<br>
Classification and regression files<br>
Meaning models were splitted by problem they solve<br>
<br>
Now architecture changed splitting data by model type!<br>
### New Models!<br>
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor
- RandomForestClassifier

It's freakin' amazing that we have 3 new models in 1 update!<br>
See yaðŸ‘‹!<br>

## LUNA-R Big Update!
### Meet GradientBoostings!
GradientBoostingRegressor and GradientBoostingClassifier are now available in ensembles!<br>
We're super excited to present this powerful and efficient sequential algorithm<br>

GradientBoosting expands and increases possiblilities of simple Decision Trees<br>
Enjoy Regression and Classification with LUNA-R GradientBoosted algorithms!<br>

## LUNA-R... A lot of newsðŸ˜ž
Let's start with Good News:<br>
### KMeans Clustering V 0.01 is now available!ðŸŽ‰
It doesn't only mean that this algorithm is implemented, but it also signs that LUNA-R now can solve Unsupervised Learning!!!<br>
That's really, really cool!<br>
**See details im models/clustering**
<br>
### Bad News...
Thankfully it's not about LUNA-R.<br>
### My GitHub profile was suspendedðŸ˜­
Some *not good man tried to sign in to my profile.<br>
GitHub noticed it and temporary blocked me.<br>
I mean... I can use my profile, but nobody else can see it and even read!<br>
Now my profile redirects to 404(bruh)<br>
I already wrote a request to GitHub support Team (8 hours ago) but didn't get any response<br>
Despite the fact that it broke me a bit I'll continue to work, as LUNA-R must be finished!ðŸ’ª<br>
Hope for help from GitHub team<br>
PeaceðŸ’–
