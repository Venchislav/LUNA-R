## LUNA-R Main Growth!
LUNA-R Main system is improving spreading to different components and submodules.<br>
Dev Team (1 person bruh) trying to build flexible architecture.<br>
Of course LUNA-R is not new Scikit Learn, but these are just first versions.<br>
News: <br>
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are now V 0.002
  - Details:<br> More Flexible <br> Loss Output added <br> Bug Fix
- Components:
  - Optimizers, Losses and more!

### Model Main Class!
LUNA-R is positioned not only as Framework with ready-to-use models, but also as an educational material in form of ML Framework<br>
##### Introducing: <br>
MODEL!<br>
Not a big update, but it makes development process easier and model files cleaner. <br>
All routine actions already implemented in Model class! <br>

## LUNA-R Big Update!
### Decision Tree V 0.01!
<br>
One of the:

- best
- most popular
- most useful

ML algorithms on board! <br>

Really different from previous<br>
But still great!<br>

All math functions and so on on board!<br>

Oh and...<br>

Last, but not Least...<br>
### Examples!<br>

Examples are pieces of code that you can examine and check out in order to understand framework and see its practical usage<br>
